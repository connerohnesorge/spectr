# Spectr: Next Task Execution

## Overview

This command automatically executes the next pending task in the current spectr change proposal.

## Usage

```
/spectr:next [change-id]
```

If no change-id is provided, the command will attempt to find the current change proposal directory.

## What This Command Does

1. **Discovers** the change proposal directory in `{{ .ChangesDir }}/`
2. **Parses** the `tasks.jsonc` file to find the first pending task
3. **Executes** the task based on its description
4. **Updates** task status: pending → in_progress → completed
5. **Reports** what was done and what's next

## Task Execution Flow

```
User: /spectr:next

AI Agent:
→ Found next pending task: #5 "Update API documentation"
→ Marked task #5 as in_progress
→ Updating API documentation...
→ Completed task #5
→ Next task: #6 "Run tests and fix any failures"
```

## Implementation Details

### Task Discovery
- Supports both v1 flat `tasks.jsonc` files and v2 hierarchical files with `$ref` links
- Automatically follows `$ref` links to child task files
- Includes circular reference detection
- Returns the first task with status "pending"

### Status Management
- Updates task status atomically to prevent corruption
- Handles both flat and hierarchical task structures
- Implements parent task status aggregation when children complete
- Provides clear error messages for common failure scenarios

### Error Handling
- **No pending tasks**: Reports all tasks are completed
- **Malformed tasks.jsonc**: Provides parsing error details
- **Missing $ref files**: Reports which child files are missing
- **Status update failures**: Attempts rollback to previous state

## Example Task Types

### Code Implementation Tasks
```
Found next pending task: #3.2 "Add validation logic"
→ Implementing validation in internal/validation/...
→ Updated task status to completed
```

### Testing Tasks
```
Found next pending task: #4.1 "Create unit tests"
→ Creating test file internal/pkg/test_test.go
→ Running tests...
→ All tests passing
→ Updated task status to completed
```

### Documentation Tasks
```
Found next pending task: #5.3 "Update API documentation"
→ Updating docs/api.md with new endpoints
→ Added examples for new features
→ Updated task status to completed
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify** the proposed task before execution
2. **Update status immediately** after starting work
3. **Report progress** clearly and concisely
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with helpful messages
5. **Suggest next steps** after completion

## Integration with Spectr Workflow

This command integrates seamlessly with the spectr workflow:
- Works with proposals created via `/spectr:proposal`
- Complements `/spectr:apply` for full change lifecycle
- Maintains task state consistency across executions
- Supports both manual and automated task progression
