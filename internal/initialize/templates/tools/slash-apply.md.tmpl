**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `{{ .AgentsFile }}` (located inside the `{{ .BaseDir }}/` directory—run `ls {{ .BaseDir }}` or `spectr init` if you don't see it) if you need additional Spectr conventions or clarifications.

**Steps**
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change.
3. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in `tasks.md` is finished.
4. Update the checklist after all work is done so each task is marked `- [x]` and reflects reality.
5. Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/` and `{{ .SpecsDir }}/` directories when additional context is required.

**Reference**
- Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/proposal.md` for proposal details.
- Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for delta specs.
