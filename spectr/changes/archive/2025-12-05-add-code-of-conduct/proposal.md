# Change: Add Code of Conduct

## Why

Spectr currently lacks a formal code of conduct. As an open-source project, establishing clear community standards ensures contributors understand behavioral expectations and creates a welcoming environment for all participants.

## What Changes

- Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to the repository root
- Adopt guidelines inspired by Ladybird Browser / Ruby Community Conduct Guideline
- Focus on tolerance, respectful communication, assuming good intentions, and zero tolerance for harassment

## Impact

- Affected specs: New `community-guidelines` capability
- Affected code: None (documentation only)
- Breaking changes: None
