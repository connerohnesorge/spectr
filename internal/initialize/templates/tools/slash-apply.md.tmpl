# Guardrails
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `{{ .AgentsFile }}` (located inside the `{{ .BaseDir }}/` directory—run `ls {{ .BaseDir }}` or `spectr init` if you don't see it) if you need additional Spectr conventions or clarifications.

# Steps
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. Run `spectr accept <id>` to convert `tasks.md` to `tasks.json` format for stable task tracking.
2. Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.json` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
3. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change. Update the task status in `tasks.json` after verifying the work.
4. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in `tasks.json` is finished.
5. Verify/Update all task status in `tasks.json` after all work is done. Tasks have status values: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`.
6. Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/` and `{{ .SpecsDir }}/` directories when additional context is required.

# Reference
- Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/proposal.md` for proposal details.
- Read `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for delta specs.
