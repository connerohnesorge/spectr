# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to enhance the interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and applications by providing structured context management. It acts as a standardized way for AI agents to connect to external data sources or tools, enabling seamless and secure two-way communication.

## Key Concepts

- **Protocol**: A standardized open protocol that standardizes how AI applications interact with external data and tools.
- **Connectors**: Bridges that allow LLMs to read/write data to various systems (databases, APIs, file systems).
- **Security**: Designed with security in mind to control access to resources.
