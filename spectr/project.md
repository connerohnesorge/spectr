## Project Conventions

### Code Style

[Describe your code style preferences, formatting rules, and naming conventions]

### Architecture Patterns

[Document your architectural decisions and patterns]

### Testing Strategy

[Explain your testing approach and requirements]

### Git Workflow

[Describe your branching strategy and commit conventions]

## Domain Context

[Add domain-specific knowledge that AI assistants need to understand]

### File Purposes

Each file in the `spectr/` directory serves a specific purpose:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `proposal.md` | High-level why, what, and impact |
| `tasks.md` | Implementation checklist |
| `spec.md` | Requirements and acceptance criteria |
| `design.md` | Specific implementation details (code structures, APIs, |
|             | data models) |

**About `design.md`**: This file contains **specific implementation details** for
  developers and AI agents—not abstract principles or high-level decisions. Include:

- Data structures and type definitions
- API signatures and interfaces
- File and directory structures
- Code snippets showing patterns
- Configuration schemas

Create `design.md` only when:

- Cross-cutting change (multiple systems)
- New architectural patterns
- External dependencies or data model changes
- Security, performance, or migration complexity

## Important Constraints

[List any technical, business, or regulatory constraints]

## External Dependencies

[Document key external services, APIs, or systems]
