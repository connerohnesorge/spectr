# Spectr command for Gemini CLI
description = "Implement an approved Spectr change and keep tasks in sync."
prompt = """
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `spectr/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `spectr/` directory—run `ls spectr` or `spectr init` if you don't see it) if you need additional Spectr conventions or clarifications.

**Steps**
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. Run `spectr accept <id>` to convert `tasks.md` to `tasks.json` format for stable task tracking.
2. Read `spectr/changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.json` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
3. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change.
4. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in `tasks.json` is finished.
5. Update task status in `tasks.json` after all work is done. Use status values: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`.
6. Read `spectr/changes/` and `spectr/specs/` directories when additional context is required.

**Reference**
- Read `spectr/changes/<id>/proposal.md` for proposal details.
- Read `spectr/changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for delta specs.
