# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct establishes community behavioral standards for the Spectr
project. Our goal is to create a welcoming, productive environment where
contributors can collaborate effectively regardless of background or experience
level.

## Community Guidelines

### Tolerance of Opposing Views

Participants in the Spectr community are expected to be tolerant of opposing
views. Technical discussions often involve differing opinions on design
decisions, implementation approaches, and project direction. We encourage
healthy debate while respecting that others may hold different perspectives.

### Respectful Communication

All participants must keep language and actions free of personal attacks and
disparaging remarks. Critique ideas, not people. When providing feedback:

- Focus on the technical merits of contributions
- Avoid inflammatory or derogatory language
- Express disagreement constructively
- Refrain from personal attacks or insults directed at individuals

### Assuming Good Intentions

When interpreting the words and actions of others, assume good intentions.
Miscommunication happens, especially in written form across different cultures
and languages. Before responding negatively:

- Consider that the other person may have expressed themselves poorly
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assuming the worst
- Give others the benefit of the doubt
- Remember that contributors are working toward shared goals

### Zero Tolerance for Harassment

Behavior that can reasonably be considered harassment will not be tolerated.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Unwelcome comments regarding personal characteristics
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Continued one-on-one communication after a request to stop
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

- A warning from project maintainers
- Temporary or permanent exclusion from project spaces
- Removal of contributions at maintainer discretion

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these
standards. They will take appropriate action in response to behavior that
violates this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from the [Ruby Community Conduct
Guideline](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/) and the [Ladybird
Browser](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird) project's approach to
community standards.
