# Spectr Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/{{ .AgentsFile }}` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/{{ .AgentsFile }}` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

When delegating tasks from a change proposal to subagents:
- Provide the proposal path: `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/proposal.md`
- Include task context: `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/tasks.jsonc`
- Reference delta specs: `{{ .ChangesDir }}/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
