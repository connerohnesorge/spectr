## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Create ASCII art representation of the ghost gopher mascot in `internal/initialize/wizard.go`
- [ ] 1.2 Update the `asciiArt` constant to include both mascot and "SPECTR" text in a side-by-side or stacked layout
- [ ] 1.3 Ensure gradient rendering works correctly with the new combined banner
- [ ] 1.4 Test the banner displays correctly at various terminal widths (80, 100, 120 columns)

## 2. Verification

- [ ] 2.1 Run `spectr init` in a test directory and visually verify the mascot appears
- [ ] 2.2 Verify the gradient colors apply smoothly across the mascot ASCII art
- [ ] 2.3 Run existing init tests to ensure no regressions
